        <h1>Highest Percentage of NYC Schools Offering Arts Education in Four Areas was in Queens</h1>

        <h3>December 11, 2020</h3>
        <p>School districts in Queens had the greatest percent of schools offering arts education in all four subject areas—dance, music, theater and visual arts—during the 2017-18 school year, according to the annual Arts Report.
          The data from the Arts Report covers schools serving grades 1-5 and is distributed by the New York City Department of Education each year.</p>

        <p>School District 28 in Queens had the highest percent of elementary schools with arts instruction in all four areas, 78%, while School District 23 in Brooklyn reported 0% of their schools had arts instruction in all four areas. </p>

        <p>According to PhD Candidate Elias Gross, continuing broad arts education into later years is a necessary step to better access to the arts.</p>

        <p>"The bar to entering an orchestra is so astronomically high that you're basically just like waiting for someone to die," he said, encouraging public schools to offer arts education programs beyond elementary school to combat this issue.
